<b>1 -</b> Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah.  
<b>2 -</b> She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.  
<b>3 -</b> Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.  
<b>4 -</b> The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.

<b>5 -</b> Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.  
<b>6 -</b> But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.

<b>7 -</b> Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.  
<b>8 -</b> Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.  
<b>9 -</b> His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,  
<b>10 -</b> the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.  
<b>11 -</b> After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.

<h1>Ishmael’s Sons</h1>

<b>12 -</b> This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Sarah’s slave, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.

<b>13 -</b> These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  
<b>14 -</b> Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  
<b>15 -</b> Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.  
<b>16 -</b> These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.  
<b>17 -</b> Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.  
<b>18 -</b> His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they lived in hostility toward all the tribes related to them.

<h1>Jacob and Esau</h1>

<b>19 -</b> This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Isaac.

<b>20 -</b> Abraham became the father of Isaac,  
<b>21 -</b> and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.

<b>22 -</b> Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The Lord answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.  
<b>23 -</b> The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?”  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she went to inquire of the Lord.

<b>24 -</b> The Lord said to her,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Two nations are in your womb,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and two peoples from within you will be separated;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one people will be stronger than the other,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the older will serve the younger.”

<b>25 -</b> When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.  
<b>26 -</b> The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.  
<b>27 -</b> After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob.  
<b>28 -</b> Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.

<b>29 -</b> The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents.  
<b>30 -</b> Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.

<b>31 -</b> Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.  
<b>32 -</b> He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!” (That is why he was also called Edom.)

<b>33 -</b> Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”

<b>34 -</b> “Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?”

<b>35 -</b> But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.

<b>36 -</b> Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left.

<b>37 -</b> So Esau despised his birthright."""
