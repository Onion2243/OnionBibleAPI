<b>1-</b> Then Jacob called for his sons and said: “Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.

<b>2-</b>  
“Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listen to your father Israel.

<b>3-</b>  
“Reuben, you are my firstborn,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my might, the first sign of my strength,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excelling in honor, excelling in power.

<b>4-</b>  
Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you went up onto your father’s bed,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onto my couch and defiled it.

<b>5-</b>  
“Simeon and Levi are brothers—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their swords[a] are weapons of violence.

<b>6-</b>  
Let me not enter their council,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me not join their assembly,  
for they have killed men in their anger  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.

<b>7-</b>  
Cursed be their anger, so fierce,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their fury, so cruel!  
I will scatter them in Jacob  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and disperse them in Israel.

<b>8-</b>  
“Judah,[b] your brothers will praise you;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your hand will be on the neck of your enemies;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your father’s sons will bow down to you.

<b>9-</b>  
You are a lion’s cub, Judah;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you return from the prey, my son.  
Like a lion he crouches and lies down,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a lioness—who dares to rouse him?

<b>10-</b>  
The scepter will not depart from Judah,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,[c]  
until he to whom it belongs[d] shall come  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the obedience of the nations shall be his.

<b>11-</b>  
He will tether his donkey to a vine,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his colt to the choicest branch;  
he will wash his garments in wine,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his robes in the blood of grapes.

<b>12-</b>  
His eyes will be darker than wine,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his teeth whiter than milk.[e]

<b>13-</b>  
“Zebulun will live by the seashore  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and become a haven for ships;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his border will extend toward Sidon.

<b>14-</b>  
“Issachar is a rawboned[f] donkey  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lying down among the sheep pens.[g]

<b>15-</b>  
When he sees how good is his resting place  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and how pleasant is his land,  
he will bend his shoulder to the burden  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and submit to forced labor.

<b>16-</b>  
“Dan[h] will provide justice for his people  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as one of the tribes of Israel.

<b>17-</b>  
Dan will be a snake by the roadside,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a viper along the path,  
that bites the horse’s heels  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that its rider tumbles backward.

<b>18-</b>  
“I look for your deliverance, Lord.

<b>19-</b>  
“Gad[i] will be attacked by a band of raiders,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he will attack them at their heels.

<b>20-</b>  
“Asher’s food will be rich;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will provide delicacies fit for a king.

<b>21-</b>  
“Naphtali is a doe set free  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that bears beautiful fawns.[j]

<b>22-</b>  
“Joseph is a fruitful vine,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fruitful vine near a spring,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose branches climb over a wall.[k]

<b>23-</b>  
With bitterness archers attacked him;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they shot at him with hostility.

<b>24-</b>  
But his bow remained steady,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his strong arms stayed[l] limber,  
because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,

<b>25-</b>  
because of your father’s God, who helps you,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the Almighty,[m] who blesses you  
with blessings of the skies above,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blessings of the deep springs below,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blessings of the breast and womb.

<b>26-</b>  
Your father’s blessings are greater  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the blessings of the ancient mountains,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than[n] the bounty of the age-old hills.  
Let all these rest on the head of Joseph,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the brow of the prince among[o] his brothers.

<b>27-</b>  
“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the morning he devours the prey,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the evening he divides the plunder.”

<b>28-</b> All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him.

<h1>The Death of Jacob</h1>

<b>29-</b> Then he gave them these instructions: “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,  
<b>30-</b> the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.  
<b>31-</b> There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah.  
<b>32-</b> The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites.[p]”

<b>33-</b> When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.
