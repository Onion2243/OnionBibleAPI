<b>1 -</b> Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
<b>2 -</b> When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.

<b>3 -</b> Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
<b>4 -</b> He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.
<b>5 -</b> I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’”

<b>6 -</b> When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”

<b>7 -</b> In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well.
<b>8 -</b> He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape.”

<b>9 -</b> Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, Lord, you who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’
<b>10 -</b> I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.
<b>11 -</b> Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.
<b>12 -</b> But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’”

<b>13 -</b> He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:
<b>14 -</b> two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
<b>15 -</b> thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
<b>16 -</b> He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.”

<b>17 -</b> He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’
<b>18 -</b> then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’”

<b>19 -</b> He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
<b>20 -</b> And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”
<b>21 -</b> So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.

<h1>Jacob Wrestles With God</h1>
<b>22 -</b> That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
<b>23 -</b> After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.
<b>24 -</b> So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.
<b>25 -</b> When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
<b>26 -</b> Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”
    But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”

<b>27 -</b> The man asked him, “What is your name?”
    “Jacob,” he answered.

<b>28 -</b> Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”

<b>29 -</b> Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.”
    But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there.

<b>30 -</b> So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”

<b>31 -</b> The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.
<b>32 -</b> Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon."""
