<b>1 -</b> Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants.  
<b>2 -</b> He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.  
<b>3 -</b> He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.

<b>4 -</b> But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.  
<b>5 -</b> Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.”

<b>6 -</b> Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down.  
<b>7 -</b> Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.

<b>8 -</b> Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?”  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he said.

<b>9 -</b> But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.”  
<b>10 -</b> “No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.  
<b>11 -</b> Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.

<b>12 -</b> Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.”

<b>13 -</b> But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.  
<b>14 -</b> So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”

<b>15 -</b> Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.”  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”

<b>16 -</b> So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.  
<b>17 -</b> Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth.

<b>18 -</b> After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.  
<b>19 -</b> For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.  
<b>20 -</b> There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel."""
