<b>1-</b> Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, “With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.”  
<b>2-</b> Later she gave birth to his brother Abel.

Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.  
<b>3-</b> In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord.  
<b>4-</b> And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering,  
<b>5-</b> but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.

<b>6-</b> Then the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?  
<b>7-</b> If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”

<b>8-</b> Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.” While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.

<b>9-</b> Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?”  
“I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”

<b>10-</b> The Lord said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.  
<b>11-</b> Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.  
<b>12-</b> When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”

<b>13-</b> Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is more than I can bear.  
<b>14-</b> Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”

<b>15-</b> But the Lord said to him, “Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.  
<b>16-</b> So Cain went out from the Lord’s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

<b>17-</b> Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.  
<b>18-</b> To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.

<b>19-</b> Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.  
<b>20-</b> Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.  
<b>21-</b> His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.  
<b>22-</b> Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah.

<b>23-</b> Lamech said to his wives,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Adah and Zillah, listen to me;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wives of Lamech, hear my words.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have killed a man for wounding me,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a young man for injuring me.”

<b>24-</b> If Cain is avenged seven times,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Lamech seventy-seven times.”

<b>25-</b> Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”  
<b>26-</b> Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh.

At that time people began to call on the name of the Lord."""
