<b>1 -</b> Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.  
<b>2 -</b> She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.

<b>3 -</b> Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.  
<b>4 -</b> “I am a foreigner and stranger among you.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.”

<b>5 -</b> The Hittites replied to Abraham,  
<b>6 -</b> “Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.”

<b>7 -</b> Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites.  
<b>8 -</b> He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf  
<b>9 -</b> so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.”

<b>10 -</b> Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.  
<b>11 -</b> “No, my lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.”

<b>12 -</b> Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.  
<b>13 -</b> He said to Ephron in their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.”

<b>14 -</b> Ephron answered Abraham,  
<b>15 -</b> “Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”

<b>16 -</b> Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.

<b>17 -</b> So Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded  
<b>18 -</b> to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.  
<b>19 -</b> Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan.  
<b>20 -</b> So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.
