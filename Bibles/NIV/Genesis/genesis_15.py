<b>1 -</b> After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not be afraid, Abram.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am your shield,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your very great reward.”

<b>2 -</b> But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”  
<b>3 -</b> And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.”

<b>4 -</b> Then the word of the Lord came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.”  
<b>5 -</b> He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”

<b>6 -</b> Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.

<b>7 -</b> He also said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.”

<b>8 -</b> But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?”

<b>9 -</b> So the Lord said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”

<b>10 -</b> Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.  
<b>11 -</b> Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.

<b>12 -</b> As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.  
<b>13 -</b> Then the Lord said to him, “Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there.  
<b>14 -</b> But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.  
<b>15 -</b> You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.  
<b>16 -</b> In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”

<b>17 -</b> When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.  
<b>18 -</b> On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—  
<b>19 -</b> the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,  
<b>20 -</b> Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,  
<b>21 -</b> Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”"""
