<b>1-</b> This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s sons, who themselves had sons after the flood.

<h2>The Japhethites</h2>

<b>2-</b> The sons of Japheth:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras.

<b>3-</b> The sons of Gomer:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah.

<b>8-</b> Cush was the father of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth.  
<b>9-</b> He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; that is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord.”  
<b>10-</b> The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in Shinar.  
<b>11-</b> From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah  
<b>12-</b> and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city.

<b>13-</b> Egypt was the father of  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,  
<b>14-</b> Pathrusites, Kasluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,  
<b>16-</b> Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,  
<b>17-</b> Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,  
<b>18-</b> Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites.

Later the Canaanite clans scattered  
<b>19-</b> and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha.

<b>20-</b> These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.

<h2>The Semites</h2>

<b>21-</b> Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.

<b>22-</b> The sons of Shem:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.

<b>23-</b> The sons of Aram:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshek.

<b>24-</b> Arphaxad was the father of Shelah,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Shelah the father of Eber.

<b>25-</b> Two sons were born to Eber:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.

<b>26-</b> Joktan was the father of  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,  
<b>27-</b> Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,

<b>29-</b> Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.

<b>30-</b> The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.

<b>31-</b> These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.

<b>32-</b> These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations.  
From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood."""
