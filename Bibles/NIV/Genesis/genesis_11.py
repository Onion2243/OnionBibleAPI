<b>1-</b> Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.  
<b>2-</b> As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.

<b>3-</b> They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.  
<b>4-</b> Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”

<b>5-</b> But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.  
<b>6-</b> The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.  
<b>7-</b> Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”

<b>8-</b> So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.  
<b>9-</b> That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
